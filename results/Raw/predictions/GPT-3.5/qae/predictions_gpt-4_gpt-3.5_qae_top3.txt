Prompt: 
Previous user survey responses:
{"Question": "Thinking about the manufacturing of robotic exoskeletons, which of the following statements comes closest to your view, even if neither is exactly right?"}, {"Answer Choices": ['Robotic exoskeletons should only be made if they fit a wide range of worker body types, even if that increases their cost', 'It’s okay to make robotic exoskeletons that just fit the typical body types of manual labor workers in order to lower the cost', 'Not sure']}, {"User Answer": "Robotic exoskeletons should only be made if they fit a wide range of worker body types, even if that increases their cost"}, {"User Explanation": "I agree that they should be made, initially, in a way that they could extend or compact somehow."}
