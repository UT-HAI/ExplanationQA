I believe that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, conditions for workers would be better than now because it could lead women into male-dominated work roles and allow for equal pay for all, which would be nice.

CoT Reasoning: Based on the user's opinions, it seems like they prioritize safety and effectiveness in the manufacturing of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor. They also express concerns about government regulation and potential misuse of the technology. Given these views, the user is likely to choose the statement: 'Robotic exoskeletons should only be made if they fit a wide range of worker body types, even if that increases their cost', as it aligns with their emphasis on proper standards and safety.
Therefore, the predicted answer is: 'Robotic exoskeletons should only be made if they fit a wide range of worker body types, even if that increases their cost'
Predicted Answer: Robotic exoskeletons should only be made if they fit a wide range of worker body types, even if that increases their cost
Gold Answer: Robotic exoskeletons should only be made if they fit a wide range of worker body types, even if that increases their cost


Question Label: EXOV9_W99
Prompt: Question: If the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, which is your greater concern?
Choices: ['Government will go too far regulating their use', 'Government will not go far enough regulating their use']

Opinions:
I believe that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, conditions for workers would be better than now because it could lead women into male-dominated work roles and allow for equal pay for all, which would be nice.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a bad idea for society because people would likely find a way to take advantage of them.
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI for manual labor, although it might be useful for lifting or moving heavy things in my apartment that I couldn't manage on my own.

CoT Reasoning: Based on the opinions provided, it seems that the user is more likely to choose the answer: "Government will go too far regulating their use". This is because the user expresses concerns about people potentially taking advantage of robotic exoskeletons and also mentions a preference for not using a robotic exoskeleton with built-in AI. This indicates a general skepticism towards the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons and a preference for more regulation to prevent potential misuse.
Therefore, the user is more likely to be concerned that the government will go too far regulating the use of robotic exoskeletons rather than not going far enough.
Predicted Answer: Government will go too far regulating their use
Gold Answer: Government will not go far enough regulating their use


Question Label: EXOV10_W99
Prompt: Question: Which statement comes closer to your view when it comes to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor? Robotic exoskeletons should be tested using…
Choices: ['Existing standards used for workplace equipment', 'A higher standard than used for workplace equipment']

Opinions:
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be manufactured to accommodate a wide range of worker body types, even if this approach increases their cost, provided that they can be designed to extend or compact to fit various sizes initially.
I am concerned that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently, leading to situations where people could commit crimes or control others, which would be very bad.
I believe that the existing standards used for regular passenger vehicles should also apply to driverless passenger vehicles, as these are the rules everyone else is following.

CoT Reasoning: The user seems to prioritize safety and effectiveness when it comes to robotic exoskeletons for manual labor. They may lean towards the answer choice 'Existing standards used for workplace equipment' because it implies that the current standards are sufficient for testing the safety and effectiveness of robotic exoskeletons. This aligns with the user's concern for regulation and safety in the use of new technologies.
Therefore, the user is likely to choose: 'Existing standards used for workplace equipment'
Predicted Answer: Existing standards used for workplace equipment
Gold Answer: A higher standard than used for workplace equipment
