Question: If the use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby’s risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions over their lifetime becomes widespread, do you think people’s quality of life would be…
Choices: ['Better than now', 'Worse than now', 'About the same as now']

Opinions:
I think that the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions over their lifetime would be a bad idea for society.
I think most parents would not feel pressured to use gene editing to reduce their baby’s risk of serious diseases or health conditions.
I would definitely not want gene editing to reduce my baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions over their lifetime.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases or health conditions.
I feel that using gene editing to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious diseases or health conditions is meddling with nature and crosses a line we shouldn't cross.
