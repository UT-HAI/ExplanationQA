Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would significantly decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because many current drivers are not competent, yet society heavily relies on driving and it's difficult to restrict people from it.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles won't make much difference because, although driving could become cheaper with electrification, people who want to avoid unpleasant smells or mess in a shared vehicle will likely still prefer to own their own cars.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially since driver assist systems are often unfairly expected to eliminate all accidents and deaths, rather than just proving to be safer on average than human drivers.

Prompt: 
Question: If the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, do you think that would…
Choices: ['Increase the gap between higher and lower-income Americans', 'Decrease the gap between higher and lower-income Americans', 'Not make much difference']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would significantly decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because many current drivers are not competent, yet society heavily relies on driving and it's difficult to restrict people from it.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because people are terribly bad at driving, with over 40,000 killed and even more injured on the roads each year, so this change will be beneficial for us.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially since driver assist systems are often unfairly expected to eliminate all accidents and deaths, rather than just proving to be safer on average than human drivers.

Question: If the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, allowing people to far more quickly and accurately process information, which is your greater concern?
Choices: ['Government will go too far regulating their use', 'Government will not go far enough regulating their use']

Opinions:
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, most people would not feel pressured to get them because they will be too expensive and not likely covered by insurance, making them prohibitive, and many will also mistrust the technology for a long time.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain to enhance our information processing capabilities is just another step in human advancement, similar to vaccinations and organ transplants, and doesn't constitute undue interference with nature.
I'm not sure if widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial or risky, mainly because I don't see the advantage unless it can significantly increase someone's IQ, which we desperately need, but I admit I'm completely uninformed on this topic.

Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe most parents would not feel pressured to opt for gene editing to reduce health risks in their baby, because there is a prevalent desire among conventional-thinking people to have others conform to what's considered "normal," as seen in our ongoing struggles with minority, gender, and LGBTQ rights.
I believe that if the use of gene editing to significantly lower a baby's risk of developing serious diseases becomes widespread, people's quality of life would be better than now because it would enhance the health of the baby and reduce both the financial and emotional burdens on its caregivers.

Choices: ['Feel pressure to get this for their baby', 'Not feel pressure to get this for their baby']

Opinions:
"I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions would be a good idea for society because people will appreciate being able to control genetic factors to ensure the birth of healthy babies, as all humans want to give birth to sound and healthy offspring."
I would definitely want gene editing for my baby to greatly reduce their risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions, because having a healthy baby brings a lifetime of joy and the opportunity to watch them grow into a fine, healthy adult.
I believe that if gene editing is widely used to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious diseases or health conditions, the quality of life will be better than it is now because it is akin to immunizing a baby before they are fully formed, aiming to reduce or eliminate serious health issues through well-researched applications.

I believe that using gene editing to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious diseases is just another way we are trying to improve ourselves, and I support it if it enhances someone's life in the future.
I don't think most parents would feel pressured to use gene editing to reduce their baby's risk of developing serious diseases, although they might be open to it.

Question: Do you think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing…
Choices: ['More fair', 'Less fair', 'Not make much difference']

Opinions:
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police is a good idea for society because it can make it easier to identify offenders of violent and robbery crimes, and potentially reduce the likelihood of crimes happening in public.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S., even in areas without this technology, because people would become paranoid and avoid committing crimes in person.
I am most concerned that, if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate its deployment, potentially installing it in extremely inappropriate places like bathrooms and in every corner of impoverished neighborhoods, leading to a pervasive sense of surveillance that makes people uncomfortable.
