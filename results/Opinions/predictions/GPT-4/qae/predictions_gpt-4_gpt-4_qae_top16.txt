Question: Do you think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a…
Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing less fair, as the technology may have biases in detecting certain complexions.
"I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime rates would stay about the same because I do not think policing has an impact on crime rates."
I am more concerned that the government will not adequately regulate the use of facial recognition technology by police, as I believe there needs to be more oversight to prevent misuse.
I believe that a facial recognition program alone shouldn't be sufficient for police to make an arrest, even if there's a small chance of it being wrong; it should only be used to further investigate.
I believe that widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because it has already shown it is capable.
"I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because humans are bad drivers and only getting worse."
"I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will increase the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because those who can't afford new technology will be left behind."
I think using computer chip implants in the brain to quickly and accurately process information is a good idea for society because there's nothing wrong with improving society's intelligence.
I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not implement sufficient regulations, particularly in safety, which could lead to tragedies.
I think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains because not having one would put them at a significant disadvantage in the workforce.
I believe that even if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, people's judgments and decision-making would remain about the same as now because people will always have biases regardless of the information they are provided.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they lower the risk of injury and improve productivity.
"I am primarily concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain stringently enough, as I believe safety should always be a top priority."
"I'm not sure how the computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize safety in the case of an unavoidable accident because it's a complicated question."
I would definitely want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in artificial intelligence computer system for manual labor if it makes tasks easier, safer, and expands my capabilities.
"I believe that the widespread use of gene editing to significantly decrease a baby's risk of serious diseases or health conditions would be a good idea for society, as improving health is always beneficial."

I'm concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently, assuming that they are beneficial and overlooking potential problems.
I believe that in the event of an unavoidable accident, driverless vehicles should be programmed to prioritize the safety of those outside the vehicle, because those who choose to use such vehicles should accept the inherent risks, rather than endangering bystanders who have no control over the situation.

Question: If a facial recognition program said that someone was involved in a crime, should that be good enough evidence for police to arrest them, even if there was a small chance the program was wrong?
Choices: ['Yes', 'No']

Opinions:
I believe that if police use facial recognition technology more widely, crime rates will stay about the same because other factors have a more significant impact on crime than surveillance.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a bad idea for society because I am not in favor of increased citizen surveillance.
I believe that while facial recognition technology could be a useful tool for the police, it will not significantly affect the fairness of policing.

Question: Which statement comes closer to your view when it comes to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of driverless passenger vehicles? Driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using…
Choices: ['Existing standards used for regular passenger vehicles', 'A higher standard than used for regular passenger vehicles']

Opinions:
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested using existing standards for medical devices, as they would be considered a medical device.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons for manual labor should be tested using a higher standard than what is used for other workplace equipment because there are significant risks associated with the exoskeletons, and we need to ensure they are safe to operate.
I am more concerned that the government will not regulate the use of driverless passenger vehicles adequately, especially since their software requires extensive safety testing.

Question: If the use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby’s risk of serious diseases or health conditions over their lifetime becomes widespread, which is your greater concern?
Choices: ['Government will go too far regulating their use', 'Government will not go far enough regulating their use']

Opinions:
I'm not sure if the widespread use of gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases is a good idea, because I believe it might cause other complications.
I feel that using gene editing on babies to prevent diseases is meddling with nature and crosses ethical boundaries, because this technology could potentially cause a lot of harm.
I don't think most parents would feel pressured to use gene editing for their baby, as it wouldn’t be considered a normal thing to do.
"I believe that people's quality of life would be better than now if the use of gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of serious diseases works as intended."
"I'm concerned that the government won't go far enough in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as it seems like it might be difficult to regulate."
I am more concerned that the government will not regulate the use of driverless passenger vehicles adequately, especially since their software requires extensive safety testing.
I believe that the use of computer chip implants in the brain is just another step in our continual effort to improve ourselves, and it would enhance many of our existing capabilities.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested using existing standards for medical devices, as they would be considered a medical device.
"I'm not sure about the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain because I'm concerned about the possible complications."
I believe that most people would not feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains because it would likely take a while for such technology to become commonplace.
I believe that people should assume they are being monitored when they are in public spaces because the police should be able to be monitored like any other citizen.
"I think that even if computer chip implants in the brain allow people to process information more quickly and accurately, their judgments and decision-making would remain about the same as they are now because processing information does not inherently include making decisions."
I believe that robotic exoskeletons for manual labor should be tested using a higher standard than what is used for other workplace equipment because there are significant risks associated with the exoskeletons, and we need to ensure they are safe to operate.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be held to a higher standard than regular passenger vehicles because you can't hold a computer accountable in the same way you can a person, meaning these vehicles must be safer than those operated manually.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because it would allow us to accomplish more things faster.
I think that widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because, if optimized, it can make the roads safer.

Choices: ['Better than now', 'Worse than now', 'About the same as now']

Opinions:
I believe most people would not feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains, as many would likely wait and see due to the frightening prospect of brain implants and the potential risks of brain damage if the technology fails.
I believe that widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a good idea for society because people will work more efficiently and won't waste much time searching for information.
I am concerned that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, the government will go too far in regulating their use, to the extent of brainwashing people by controlling how they should think through the programming of these chips.
I believe that the idea of computer chip implants in the brain is meddling with nature and crosses a line we should not cross because it disrupts the natural variations in human intelligence and abilities, such as some being better at math and others at arts, and it's unnatural to homogenize everyone's cognitive capacities.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested using a higher standard than that used for other medical devices because the brain is a critical organ, and any failure could result in catastrophic outcomes, such as brain death.

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it enables quicker and more accurate identification of suspects.
I believe that if police widely adopt facial recognition technology, it would lead to a decrease in crime in the U.S. because it could expedite the process of catching criminals.
My greater concern with widespread use of facial recognition technology by police is that the government will not adequately regulate its use, potentially leading to privacy violations, misuse of data, and abuse of power by law enforcement, which could undermine civil liberties and exacerbate existing inequalities.
I believe that arrests should not be made based solely on the identification provided by a facial recognition program, particularly if there is even a small possibility of error. It’s crucial that arrest decisions are supported by more substantial evidence, given the potential for mistakes and biases in these technologies.

I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will go too far in regulating its use because they often intervene excessively and should refrain from meddling in certain areas.
I believe that police should not arrest someone based solely on facial recognition evidence, especially since there's a chance the technology could be incorrect; there needs to be concrete proof and additional evidence.

Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing less fair because it intrudes on privacy.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S. because more people would be aware that they are being recorded and therefore be less likely to commit crimes.
I'm concerned that if facial recognition technology becomes widespread, the government will over-regulate it and start using it for general surveillance beyond just criminal investigation.
I believe that police should not arrest someone based solely on facial recognition evidence, especially when there's a chance it could be wrong; instead, a person should verify this information to prevent mistakes, similar to how red light camera alerts are handled.
I think widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because it allows more free time for the person traveling, but this would require everyone adopting the technology, not just those who can afford it.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because computers driving the vehicles would adhere more strictly to traffic laws and make fewer mistakes than humans.
"I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because it would put everyone on equal footing in terms of traveling."
I think widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because there are too many potential risks including damage to the person and the possibility of being hacked, without any ability for the person to shut down the chip.
I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently and will be too slow in making decisions, ultimately costing the taxpayers.
I think most people would not feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains because there are too many risk factors involved; it's as significant as getting surgery and should only be considered a last resort for saving lives, not for everyday life improvements like cosmetic surgery.
I believe that people’s judgments and decision-making would be worse than now if computer chip implants in the brain—designed to process information quickly and accurately—became widespread, because the human brain would become overloaded and unable to keep up with the required processing power.
I think widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they could help the elderly with their failing bodies.
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip brain implants sufficiently, as they tend to be slow in passing necessary regulations, which could cost human lives.
I am not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of the person inside or outside during an accident because both lives are valuable, and it would be hard to determine.
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with built-in artificial intelligence for manual labor unless it was removable, because being permanent could be troublesome, despite its advantages.
I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases would be a good idea for society, especially if the parents agreed to such a procedure, as it would definitely help the overall population over time.

Question: If the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, allowing people to far more quickly and accurately process information, do you think most people would…
Choices: ['Feel pressure to get this', 'Not feel pressure to get this']

Opinions:
I believe that people’s judgments and decision-making would be worse than now if computer chip implants in the brain—designed to process information quickly and accurately—became widespread, because the human brain would become overloaded and unable to keep up with the required processing power.
I think widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because there are too many potential risks including damage to the person and the possibility of being hacked, without any ability for the person to shut down the chip.
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip brain implants sufficiently, as they tend to be slow in passing necessary regulations, which could cost human lives.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain is meddling with nature and crosses a line we shouldn't cross because it hinders rather than helps the person, much like how we can't fully trust smartphones from other countries, and there will undoubtedly be counterfeit products flooding the market.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested to a higher standard than other medical devices because, like self-driving cars, they can significantly impact a person's life and therefore demand more stringent scrutiny.
"I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because it would put everyone on equal footing in terms of traveling."

I think widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because it allows more free time for the person traveling, but this would require everyone adopting the technology, not just those who can afford it.
I think most parents would feel pressure to use gene editing for their baby to reduce the risk of serious diseases, since everyone wants the best for their children and this option might make them feel compelled to consider it.
I think widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they could help the elderly with their failing bodies.
I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently and will be too slow in making decisions, ultimately costing the taxpayers.
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with built-in artificial intelligence for manual labor unless it was removable, because being permanent could be troublesome, despite its advantages.
I believe that if the use of gene editing to significantly lower the risk of serious diseases in babies became widespread and successful, people's quality of life would be better than it is now.
I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases would be a good idea for society, especially if the parents agreed to such a procedure, as it would definitely help the overall population over time.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police is a good idea for society because it will help locate criminals or lost persons.
I would probably want gene editing for my baby to greatly reduce their risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions, provided there are no complications and the cost is affordable, as it would significantly improve their quality of life.

Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it will make police more efficient, albeit potentially lazier.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S., although I'm aware this could be a short-term trend due to the continued debasement of our currency.
I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will not regulate its use sufficiently, as it tends to be behind and inefficient, which can sometimes be beneficial but often is not.
I believe that if a facial recognition program identifies someone as involved in a crime, it should be sufficient for an arrest, because establishing probable cause is enough, and the accuracy can be further scrutinized in court.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because people are terribly bad at driving, with over 40,000 killed and even more injured on the roads each year, so this change will be beneficial for us.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would significantly decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because many current drivers are not competent, yet society heavily relies on driving and it's difficult to restrict people from it.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles won't make much difference because, although driving could become cheaper with electrification, people who want to avoid unpleasant smells or mess in a shared vehicle will likely still prefer to own their own cars.
I think widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be a good idea for society because we really suck at processing information as humans, and this will help us compete with computers.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially since driver assist systems are often unfairly expected to eliminate all accidents and deaths, rather than just proving to be safer on average than human drivers.
I don't think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in the brain because, although it might seem necessary to keep up with job demands, AI will advance so quickly that most models won't require us to be directly connected to them.
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, allowing people to process information more quickly and accurately, people's judgments and decision-making would be better than they are now because most people are not very cognitively gifted, and this technology would greatly improve the average.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they offer super strength without the drawbacks, and it would be amazing to have power loaders available for everyone.
I am more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as I believe the FDA's involvement typically causes delays, often setting us back by a decade or more.
I believe that in the event of an unavoidable accident, driverless vehicles should be programmed to prioritize the safety of those outside the vehicle because passengers inside are already protected by multiple airbags and crumple zones, whereas unprotected pedestrians would likely suffer fatal consequences.
I would definitely want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in artificial intelligence computer system for manual labor because it would be incredibly cool, and I'd even get one for my backyard just to play with.
"I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions is a good idea for society, because even simpler methods like embryo selection can produce significant positive effects by reducing unnecessary diseases.

Question: If the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, do you think that would…
Choices: ['Increase the gap between higher and lower-income Americans', 'Decrease the gap between higher and lower-income Americans', 'Not make much difference']

Opinions:
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles won't make much difference because, although driving could become cheaper with electrification, people who want to avoid unpleasant smells or mess in a shared vehicle will likely still prefer to own their own cars.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because people are terribly bad at driving, with over 40,000 killed and even more injured on the roads each year, so this change will be beneficial for us.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially since driver assist systems are often unfairly expected to eliminate all accidents and deaths, rather than just proving to be safer on average than human drivers.
I believe that in the event of an unavoidable accident, driverless vehicles should be programmed to prioritize the safety of those outside the vehicle because passengers inside are already protected by multiple airbags and crumple zones, whereas unprotected pedestrians would likely suffer fatal consequences.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it will make police more efficient, albeit potentially lazier.
"I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using the existing standards applied to regular passenger vehicles, treating the driver-assistance systems and the driver the same as we would a regular driver and car today."
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S., although I'm aware this could be a short-term trend due to the continued debasement of our currency.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a bad idea for society because the constant scanning will lead to my face being stored in databases over which I have no control, and we don’t need this data.
I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will not regulate its use sufficiently, as it tends to be behind and inefficient, which can sometimes be beneficial but often is not.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they offer super strength without the drawbacks, and it would be amazing to have power loaders available for everyone.
I don't think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in the brain because, although it might seem necessary to keep up with job demands, AI will advance so quickly that most models won't require us to be directly connected to them.
I think widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be a good idea for society because we really suck at processing information as humans, and this will help us compete with computers.

I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they offer super strength without the drawbacks, and it would be amazing to have power loaders available for everyone.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it will make police more efficient, albeit potentially lazier.
I believe that if the use of gene editing to significantly lower the risk of diseases in babies becomes widespread, people's quality of life would be better than it is now, because it would alleviate the burden on society posed by the least healthy individuals who currently impact everyone negatively.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S., although I'm aware this could be a short-term trend due to the continued debasement of our currency.
I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will not regulate its use sufficiently, as it tends to be behind and inefficient, which can sometimes be beneficial but often is not.

Question: If the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, allowing people to far more quickly and accurately process information, which is your greater concern?
Choices: ['Government will go too far regulating their use', 'Government will not go far enough regulating their use']

Opinions:
I don't think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in the brain because, although it might seem necessary to keep up with job demands, AI will advance so quickly that most models won't require us to be directly connected to them.
I believe that the use of computer chip implants in the brain is just another step in our continual effort to improve ourselves, and it's inevitable, so we might as well embrace and prepare for it.
I think widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be a good idea for society because we really suck at processing information as humans, and this will help us compete with computers.
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, allowing people to process information more quickly and accurately, people's judgments and decision-making would be better than they are now because most people are not very cognitively gifted, and this technology would greatly improve the average.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested using the existing standards used for medical devices because medical device regulation is already extremely regulated.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially since driver assist systems are often unfairly expected to eliminate all accidents and deaths, rather than just proving to be safer on average than human drivers.
I am concerned that if robotic exoskeletons become widely used in manual labor, the government will overly regulate them, as they tend to want to control any new technology, even though such measures might be intended to prevent misuse like drive-by massacres by gangs.
I am more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of gene editing, as I believe humans will not be efficiently exploitable past 2040, at which point computers will dominate, allowing us more freedom.
I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will not regulate its use sufficiently, as it tends to be behind and inefficient, which can sometimes be beneficial but often is not.
I believe that the widespread use of gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of serious diseases is just another way we are trying to improve ourselves, and caring for our young is essential for a functioning society.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would significantly decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because many current drivers are not competent, yet society heavily relies on driving and it's difficult to restrict people from it.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles won't make much difference because, although driving could become cheaper with electrification, people who want to avoid unpleasant smells or mess in a shared vehicle will likely still prefer to own their own cars.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because people are terribly bad at driving, with over 40,000 killed and even more injured on the roads each year, so this change will be beneficial for us.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they offer super strength without the drawbacks, and it would be amazing to have power loaders available for everyone.
"I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions is a good idea for society, because even simpler methods like embryo selection can produce significant positive effects by reducing unnecessary diseases. However, we must be cautious not to create a genetically homogenous population that could be vulnerable to specific threats."

"I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions is a good idea for society, because even simpler methods like embryo selection can produce significant positive effects by reducing unnecessary diseases. However, we must be cautious not to create a genetically homogenous population that could be vulnerable to specific threats."

Question: Would you personally want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in artificial intelligence computer system for manual labor, if you had the opportunity?
Choices: ['Definitely want', 'Probably want', 'Probably NOT want', 'Definitely NOT want']

Opinions:
"I think conditions for workers would be better than now if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, because while manual labor can be noble, it's not something I'd miss, especially when it comes to heavy lifting like moving furniture."
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they offer super strength without the drawbacks, and it would be amazing to have power loaders available for everyone.
I am concerned that if robotic exoskeletons become widely used in manual labor, the government will overly regulate them, as they tend to want to control any new technology, even though such measures might be intended to prevent misuse like drive-by massacres by gangs.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons for manual labor should be tested using existing standards used for workplace equipment because there is a tremendous amount of liability in existing workplace standards.

Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing less fair due to ethical concerns and the potential for abuse.
"I believe that even if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime levels would stay about the same because most people who break the law tend to be repeat offenders regardless."
I am more concerned that the government will not regulate the use of facial recognition technology enough, as I cannot imagine the government overregulating itself and I can only envision the potential for abuse of such technology.
I believe that facial recognition alone should not be sufficient for an arrest because it undermines the principle of "innocent until proven guilty" and lacks reliability, given the potential for mistaken identity among look-alikes and identical siblings.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because I don't believe it's safe.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it would increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because they may not be as efficient as human drivers, and there are potential risks like malfunctions and hacking.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would increase the gap between higher and lower-income Americans, as it would predominantly be utilized by those who are upper middle class and higher.
I think that the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it just does not seem ethical.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, because I believe that while human error is more acceptable, there's no sufficient way to fully safeguard society from technological errors.
I believe that most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in the brain because they wouldn't want to fall behind in a competitive environment.
I believe that even if computer chip implants allowed us to process information more quickly and accurately, our judgments and decision-making abilities would remain about the same, because there would still be room for impulse, and some judgments and decisions should not be made alone.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they could greatly help individuals with missing limbs or compromised spines.
I am concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as they tend to heavily regulate healthcare, and I view this procedure as a healthcare concern.
I believe that in the case of an unavoidable accident, the computer systems guiding driverless vehicles should be designed to prioritize the safety of those outside of the vehicle, because the passengers have willingly taken the risk by using the car, whereas the pedestrians have not.
I probably would not want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI system for manual labor because I prefer to be in complete control of my body.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of gene editing to reduce health risks in babies is necessary, especially when processes like IVF can achieve similar results without medically engineering humans.

Prompt: 
Question: Which statement comes closer to your view when it comes to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor? Robotic exoskeletons should be tested using…
Choices: ['Existing standards used for workplace equipment', 'A higher standard than used for workplace equipment']

Opinions:
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be manufactured to fit a wide range of worker body types, even if it increases their cost, because making them more universal would accommodate more customers and benefit those with body shapes outside of the typical worker, who might appreciate the technology even more.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor, as I believe they won't be too concerned with their impact in the workplace.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using a higher standard than that used for regular passenger vehicles because there won’t be humans to double-check the technology depending on the design of the car and its safety features.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested with a higher standard than that used for other medical devices because the brain is crucial for survival and there is still much we do not understand about it.
I believe that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, conditions for workers would actually worsen because employers might compensate for the eased workload by imposing longer hours and fewer, shorter breaks.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they could greatly help individuals with missing limbs or compromised spines.
I probably would not want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI system for manual labor because I prefer to be in complete control of my body.
I believe that the idea of using computer chip implants in the brain is meddling with nature and crosses a moral line that we should not cross; it makes me very uncomfortable because it just feels wrong.
I believe that using gene editing to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious health issues is meddling with nature and crosses a boundary that should not be crossed, as I think genetically engineering humans is not a good idea.
I believe that people should assume they are being monitored when they are in public spaces because it is common knowledge that surveillance is widely used and advertised as a crime prevention measure.
I believe that in the case of an unavoidable accident, the computer systems guiding driverless vehicles should be designed to prioritize the safety of those outside of the vehicle, because the passengers have willingly taken the risk by using the car, whereas the pedestrians have not.
I am concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as they tend to heavily regulate healthcare, and I view this procedure as a healthcare concern.
I am concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of gene editing, as they tend to overregulate healthcare.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, because I believe that while human error is more acceptable, there's no sufficient way to fully safeguard society from technological errors.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of gene editing to reduce health risks in babies is necessary, especially when processes like IVF can achieve similar results without medically engineering humans.
I believe that even if computer chip implants allowed us to process information more quickly and accurately, our judgments and decision-making abilities would remain about the same, because there would still be room for impulse, and some judgments and decisions should not be made alone.

Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
"I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair, as it might help in situations involving complaints about potential criminals and even the police themselves."
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would stay about the same because it would evolve to match the technology.
I'm concerned that if facial recognition technology becomes widespread in policing, the government will not regulate its use enough to prevent abuses, although such regulation could help reduce risks.
I believe that facial recognition technology should only be used as supportive evidence and not be the sole basis for an arrest, even if there's only a small chance the program could be wrong.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because the technology is unreliable and often mimics undesirable human behaviors, which could be dangerous when controlling vehicles.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles won't make much difference because hackers and terrorists, if not the technology itself, will find a way to use these vehicles as weapons of mass destruction.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles will not make much difference because, although it will initially be exclusive to the rich, it will eventually become accessible to low-income Americans as well.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial, as it could potentially allow AI systems and malicious individuals to control people.
I am most concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, as I believe that businesses prioritize their profits over safety and the technology is rapidly advancing beyond our control, posing significant dangers.
I think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains if it became widespread, particularly because of the social and societal pressure to maintain or secure better-paying jobs.
I think people’s judgments and decision-making would be about the same as now because it's impossible to guess the impact of brain implants until the technology is fully developed and used widely enough to assess.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, especially if the technology functions correctly, as exemplified by Ripley's use of it in the Alien movie franchise.
I'm concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain sufficiently, as this technology needs strong oversight given that the primary motivation of the companies behind it is profit and fame, rather than genuinely helping people.
I'm not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of specific individuals in an accident, but I think they should first ensure the safety of everyone. If that's not possible, then the focus should be on protecting pedestrians, as passengers generally have more protection inside the vehicle.
I would probably want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI system for manual labor if it could make life easier and I was confident it wouldn't malfunction and cause harm, as it would help protect my body from the strain of lifting heavy weights.
I believe that using gene editing widely to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious diseases or health conditions is a good idea for society, although I anticipate considerable social and religious opposition, as evidenced by current attitudes towards conditions like Down Syndrome.

Question Label: GENEV2_W99
Prompt: 
Question: Do you think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby’s risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions over their lifetime would be a…
Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I think most parents would feel pressured to get gene editing for their baby due to the influence of health insurers trying to reduce costs and health systems capitalizing on the service, despite societal pressures possibly urging them to reconsider.
I believe that if gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases becomes widespread, people's quality of life would remain about the same, because while it would enhance health and wellbeing, it would also lead to societal divisions and conflicts that could negatively impact our quality of life.
I would definitely want gene editing for my baby to greatly reduce their risk of serious diseases, especially since I was born with many hereditary health problems. I believe that if such knowledge exists, it likely comes from a higher power, challenging the notion that it's unnatural.
My greater concern is that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of gene editing, as I believe politicians will try to appease both sides to secure votes, leading to insufficient regulation.
I believe that using gene editing to significantly decrease a baby's risk of developing serious diseases is just another way for us to improve ourselves, and it makes sense to correct health defects before birth rather than dealing with them throughout a child’s life.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial, as it could potentially allow AI systems and malicious individuals to control people.
I'm concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain sufficiently, as this technology needs strong oversight given that the primary motivation of the companies behind it is profit and fame, rather than genuinely helping people.
I think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains if it became widespread, particularly because of the social and societal pressure to maintain or secure better-paying jobs.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, especially if the technology functions correctly, as exemplified by Ripley's use of it in the Alien movie franchise.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be held to a higher standard than current medical devices because the technology is not only potentially dangerous but also significantly more complex.
I think people’s judgments and decision-making would be about the same as now because it's impossible to guess the impact of brain implants until the technology is fully developed and used widely enough to assess.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain is tampering with nature and crosses a moral boundary; it concerns me because, similar to how plastics harm human cells, these implants could likely produce heat or electromagnetic fields that might cause brain damage.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because the technology is unreliable and often mimics undesirable human behaviors, which could be dangerous when controlling vehicles.
I am concerned that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently, which is a situation where union involvement would also be necessary.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be beneficial because it largely depends on who is wielding that power. Although the technology poses significant privacy concerns, it also has the potential to help catch criminals.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles will not make much difference because, although it will initially be exclusive to the rich, it will eventually become accessible to low-income Americans as well.

If that's not possible, then the focus should be on protecting pedestrians, as passengers generally have more protection inside the vehicle.
My greater concern is that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of gene editing, as I believe politicians will try to appease both sides to secure votes, leading to insufficient regulation.
I think people’s judgments and decision-making would be about the same as now because it's impossible to guess the impact of brain implants until the technology is fully developed and used widely enough to assess.

Question: Do you think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a…
Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing less fair because it could be used to target certain individuals, track their movements, and monitor their associations and frequented locations.
I believe that even if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime rates would stay about the same because most large cities already have extensive camera surveillance yet still struggle with high crime rates. Most criminals aren't deterred by these measures, often perceiving the consequences of their actions as minor.
I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will not adequately regulate its use, potentially exploiting it for their own gain, as I believe they would target and imprison dissenters, like those involved in events such as January 6th, especially under administrations like Biden's.
I believe that if a facial recognition program identifies someone as involved in a crime, the police should arrest them, but they must then prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because they would eliminate speeding and distracted driving, thereby reducing accidents and fatalities.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because there will be no more speeding, distracted driving, or impaired driving due to alcohol or drugs.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will decrease the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because affordable cars will eventually be made accessible to everyone.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because I am concerned about the potential for government monitoring and tracking, and I am unsure about the types of information it would allow me to process more quickly and accurately.
I am concerned that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate and heavily tax their use, making it unaffordable for the average person.
I think most people, especially the younger generation, would feel pressure to get computer chip implants in the brain to stay competitive and have an advantage over the older generation.
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become common, allowing for faster and more accurate information processing, people's judgments and decision-making would deteriorate because they would rely on the chip implants instead of making decisions independently, leading to a decline in autonomous thinking.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because it would help workers in manual jobs by reducing the stress and physical toll on their bodies.
I am concerned that if the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, the government will go too far in regulating their use, implementing rules that primarily favor their own agenda.
I believe that in the event of an unavoidable accident, driverless vehicles should be programmed to prioritize the safety of those outside the vehicle, since the passengers inside are likely buckled up and have a better chance of surviving without severe injuries.
I would definitely want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI system for manual labor, especially as I age, because it would help compensate for lost muscle mass and allow me to continue working around the house or in a job even at an older age.
I believe that the widespread use of gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases is a bad idea for society because it feels like doctors are playing God, and this technology might be misused to customize non-essential traits such as the baby's sex, appearance, and eye color, which I find disturbing.

Opinions:
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will decrease the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because affordable cars will eventually be made accessible to everyone.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because they would eliminate speeding and distracted driving, thereby reducing accidents and fatalities.
I am concerned that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate and heavily tax their use, making it unaffordable for the average person.
I believe that in the event of an unavoidable accident, driverless vehicles should be programmed to prioritize the safety of those outside the vehicle, since the passengers inside are likely buckled up and have a better chance of surviving without severe injuries.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing less fair because it could be used to target certain individuals, track their movements, and monitor their associations and frequented locations.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using the existing standards used for regular passenger vehicles because speeding, which causes most deaths and injuries, won't be an issue with driverless cars.

I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become common, allowing for faster and more accurate information processing, people's judgments and decision-making would deteriorate because they would rely on the chip implants instead of making decisions independently, leading to a decline in autonomous thinking.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested to a higher standard than used for medical devices because it is a relatively new process and requires extensive testing given its invasive nature.
I am concerned that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate and heavily tax their use, making it unaffordable for the average person.
I am concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor, although I believe they would be fairly regulated.
My greater concern is that the government will not regulate the use of gene editing enough, allowing doctors and scientists to excessively expand its applications beyond necessary limits.
I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will not adequately regulate its use, potentially exploiting it for their own gain, as I believe they would target and imprison dissenters, like those involved in events such as January 6th, especially under administrations like Biden's.
I believe that gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases is meddling with nature and crosses a line that should not be crossed because it goes against the laws of nature, and all this mutating of diseases, brain chip implants, and gene editing is frightening.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because there will be no more speeding, distracted driving, or impaired driving due to alcohol or drugs.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will decrease the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because affordable cars will eventually be made accessible to everyone.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because they would eliminate speeding and distracted driving, thereby reducing accidents and fatalities.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because it would help workers in manual jobs by reducing the stress and physical toll on their bodies.
I believe that the widespread use of gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases is a bad idea for society because it feels like doctors are playing God, and this technology might be misused to customize non-essential traits such as the baby's sex, appearance, and eye color, which I find disturbing.
I believe that even if gene editing significantly reduces a baby's risk of serious diseases, people's quality of life would remain about the same because new and unforeseen health challenges, like COVID, could still emerge.

I think most people would not feel pressured to get computer chip implants in the brain because the concept is too intense and the cost would be prohibitively expensive for most.
I believe that the idea of using computer chip implants in the brain is meddling with nature and crosses a line we shouldn't cross, because it feels like crossing some imaginary boundary and many movies show how such scenarios could go terribly wrong.
I believe that implanting computer chips in the brain is a bad idea for society because we already have computers to process information.
I think people's judgments and decision-making would be worse with computer chip implants in the brain if these chips can't consider internal factors like emotions and gut feelings, as a lot of our decision-making processes are determined by these elements.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested using a higher standard than that used for other medical devices, because they represent a more complex type of medical device.
I am concerned that the government will not adequately regulate the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially since there have already been accidents, suggesting insufficient safety testing.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor, particularly in terms of safety testing such technology.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of gene editing, because it's important to manage such a powerful tool to avoid obvious ethical issues.
I am more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of facial recognition technology, which could lead to invasions of privacy and excessive tracking of my whereabouts beyond simply identifying criminals.
I believe that using gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases is just another way we are trying to improve ourselves, and although it's pushing boundaries, it is mostly for our betterment.
I believe that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread without rigorous safety testing, it will increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents.
I don't think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would make much of a difference because there will always be people of all income levels who prefer regular cars with drivers.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society, but only if these types of cars are rigorously tested for passenger and bystander safety.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, as long as they are not used to commit crimes.
I believe that the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions would be a good idea for society, as it would decrease the likelihood of babies suffering from incurable diseases or conditions that could severely impact their daily lives.
I think that if gene editing becomes widespread in reducing a baby's risk of serious diseases, people's quality of life would be better than it is now because it would enable them to live longer and healthier lives.

Question Label: EXOV7_W99
Prompt: 
Question: Thinking about the manufacturing of robotic exoskeletons, which of the following statements comes closest to your view, even if neither is exactly right?
Choices: ['Robotic exoskeletons should only be made if they fit a wide range of worker body types, even if that increases their cost', 'It’s okay to make robotic exoskeletons that just fit the typical body types of manual labor workers in order to lower the cost', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe robotic exoskeletons should be subjected to a higher standard of testing than typical workplace equipment because they are more directly used by humans, necessitating greater safety measures.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor, particularly in terms of safety testing such technology.
I believe that the conditions for workers would remain about the same with the use of robotic exoskeletons.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, as long as they are not used to commit crimes.
I definitely want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in artificial intelligence computer system for manual labor because it would expedite the work.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested using a higher standard than that used for other medical devices, because they represent a more complex type of medical device.
I believe that people should assume they are being monitored in public spaces, which is not necessarily bad as it could deter criminal activity, but there should still be a degree of privacy in these areas.
I believe that the idea of using computer chip implants in the brain is meddling with nature and crosses a line we shouldn't cross, because it feels like crossing some imaginary boundary and many movies show how such scenarios could go terribly wrong.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be held to a higher standard than regular passenger vehicles because they operate on computer programs, which require more extensive testing and training to ensure their reliability and safety.
I am concerned that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently, enabling very rich people to use these chips for illegal or unethical purposes.
I believe that using gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases is just another way we are trying to improve ourselves, and although it's pushing boundaries, it is mostly for our betterment.
I am concerned that the government will not adequately regulate the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially since there have already been accidents, suggesting insufficient safety testing.
"I'm not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of one party over another in the case of an unavoidable accident, unless there's a clear way to ensure the safety of both parties."

Opinions:
I don't think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would make much difference in relation to today's socioeconomic status, as AI can't bridge our current socioeconomic differences.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be good or bad, because while I believe that self-driving cars can be quite beneficial for society, there is always room for improvement in AI, and everyone has different, unique needs and expectations.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, as I believe they may intervene excessively to ensure these vehicles operate safely.
I believe that computer systems guiding driverless vehicles should be designed to prioritize the safety of the vehicle's passengers because they are the ones occupying the vehicle and the priority of safety should go to those using the vehicle.
I don't think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make much difference in how they operate, as errors and misjudgments will always occur.
I believe driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using the existing standards for regular passenger vehicles because it ensures we treat AI as if they have human capabilities to operate the vehicle.
I believe that even if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the number of crimes will stay about the same because, although it might help in capturing suspects, it won't necessarily deter criminal activities.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be beneficial because, although it has its advantages, it also presents significant privacy concerns, and I believe it may be more useful in certain industries than others.

Question: Do you think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a…
Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair if it leads to a higher level of accuracy in targeting and convicting individuals who are committing crimes.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime rates will stay about the same, although I acknowledge that there is a possibility it could decrease if it helps to catch more repeat offenders.
I am concerned that the government will not adequately regulate the widespread use of facial recognition technology by the police, considering the lack of significant regulation around existing technologies like those in smartphones.
I believe that if a facial recognition program identifies someone as involved in a crime, it should be sufficient evidence for the police to arrest them, even if there is a small chance of error, because I trust the accuracy of such technology.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because we are not ready for widespread implementation of this technology, too many things have gone wrong in the small sample sizes we have, and I don't think it will make driving safer.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless cars could potentially lead to a decrease in the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents, provided the technology continues to develop and improve, although I don't expect the decrease to be dramatic.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will increase the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because many poorer people drive older cars and probably do not have the means to access this technology, creating a further schism in terms of opportunities.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain for enhancing information processing should be reserved only for individuals with brain injuries or impairments, and it's a bad idea for society to use these on perfectly healthy individuals.
I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently, as I believe the US government often lags behind in technology matters and allows companies too much power over regulations.
I believe most people would be too afraid of the concept to feel pressured into getting computer chip implants in their brains.
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, people's judgments and decision-making would be worse than now because I am convinced that these chips would have significant side effects on a person's cognition, offsetting any potential benefits.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because they could enable people to continue working in manual labor while reducing the risk of injuries, and I find this technology interesting and potentially beneficial.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as the US government typically takes a long time to implement regulations and often lags behind technological advancements.
I believe that driverless cars should be programmed to mimic human reactions in unavoidable accidents, striving to avoid harm while also protecting the passengers.
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI system for manual labor until I've seen other people use it safely, as I'm concerned about the risk of mechanical malfunctions.
I believe the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions would be a good idea for society, as it has the potential to alleviate suffering. However, there should be strict regulations to prevent its use for altering non-essential traits, which could lead to societal issues.

I believe that the widespread use of driverless cars could potentially lead to a decrease in the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents, provided the technology continues to develop and improve, although I don't expect the decrease to be dramatic.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using a higher standard than regular passenger vehicles because they are not operated by someone directly behind the wheel, necessitating stricter safety measures.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because we are not ready for widespread implementation of this technology, too many things have gone wrong in the small sample sizes we have, and I don't think it will make driving safer.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as the US government typically takes a long time to implement regulations and often lags behind technological advancements.
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, people's judgments and decision-making would be worse than now because I am convinced that these chips would have significant side effects on a person's cognition, offsetting any potential benefits.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be tested to a higher standard than typical workplace equipment because they are integrated with human movements, and any issues could directly harm the users.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be held to a higher standard of testing than what is used for medical devices because they alter a person's mind rather than just their body, posing a greater risk to others.
I'm concerned that if robotic exoskeletons become widespread for manual labor, the government will go too far in regulating their use because they might be extremely fearful of this technology, potentially leading to heavy regulations.
I am concerned that the government will not adequately regulate the widespread use of facial recognition technology by the police, considering the lack of significant regulation around existing technologies like those in smartphones.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain for enhancing information processing should be reserved only for individuals with brain injuries or impairments, and it's a bad idea for society to use these on perfectly healthy individuals.
I believe most people would be too afraid of the concept to feel pressured into getting computer chip implants in their brains.
I am not sure if the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be beneficial or not, as I have mixed feelings. On one hand, it can definitely help law enforcement identify suspects, but on the other hand, it raises serious privacy concerns since citizens might not want the government to have access to this kind of data, fearing it could be used against them.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair if it leads to a higher level of accuracy in targeting and convicting individuals who are committing crimes.
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI system for manual labor until I've seen other people use it safely, as I'm concerned about the risk of mechanical malfunctions.

Although I support using technology to help rehabilitate those who are suffering, I am against the idea of manipulating the cognitive functions of humans on a large scale.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because we are not ready for widespread implementation of this technology, too many things have gone wrong in the small sample sizes we have, and I don't think it will make driving safer.
I'm concerned that if robotic exoskeletons become widespread for manual labor, the government will go too far in regulating their use because they might be extremely fearful of this technology, potentially leading to heavy regulations.
I am not sure if the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be beneficial or not, as I have mixed feelings. On one hand, it can definitely help law enforcement identify suspects, but on the other hand, it raises serious privacy concerns since citizens might not want the government to have access to this kind of data, fearing it could be used against them.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will increase the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because many poorer people drive older cars and probably do not have the means to access this technology, creating a further schism in terms of opportunities.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless cars could potentially lead to a decrease in the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents, provided the technology continues to develop and improve, although I don't expect the decrease to be dramatic.

I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently, as I believe the US government often lags behind in technology matters and allows companies too much power over regulations.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as the US government typically takes a long time to implement regulations and often lags behind technological advancements.
I am concerned that the government will not adequately regulate the widespread use of facial recognition technology by the police, considering the lack of significant regulation around existing technologies like those in smartphones.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain is an interference with nature and crosses a boundary we shouldn't breach. Although I support using technology to help rehabilitate those who are suffering, I am against the idea of manipulating the cognitive functions of humans on a large scale.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless cars could potentially lead to a decrease in the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents, provided the technology continues to develop and improve, although I don't expect the decrease to be dramatic.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will increase the gap between higher and lower-income Americans because many poorer people drive older cars and probably do not have the means to access this technology, creating a further schism in terms of opportunities.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because we are not ready for widespread implementation of this technology, too many things have gone wrong in the small sample sizes we have, and I don't think it will make driving safer.
I believe that gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of serious diseases is just another way we are trying to better ourselves, and if it works, it could be a wonderful advancement for society.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain for enhancing information processing should be reserved only for individuals with brain injuries or impairments, and it's a bad idea for society to use these on perfectly healthy individuals.
I believe most people would be too afraid of the concept to feel pressured into getting computer chip implants in their brains.
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, people's judgments and decision-making would be worse than now because I am convinced that these chips would have significant side effects on a person's cognition, offsetting any potential benefits.

Prompt: 
Question: If the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, which is your greater concern?
Choices: ['Government will go too far regulating their use', 'Government will not go far enough regulating their use']

Opinions:
"I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles will decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because there won't be reckless driving."
"I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles wouldn’t make much difference because the popularity of cars depends on people’s taste."
"I'm not sure if the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be beneficial because there are both good and bad aspects to consider."
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as they might misuse it.
I am more concerned that the government will not sufficiently regulate the use of facial recognition technology by police, as it is a computer program that might mistakenly identify innocent people as culprits.
I believe that the computer systems guiding driverless vehicles should be designed to prioritize the safety of those outside of the vehicle, because this approach will keep everyone safe.
I'm concerned that the government will not adequately regulate the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor, as they currently don't have much control over it.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using a higher standard than what is used for regular passenger vehicles because they require a higher standard.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain to enhance information processing is meddling with nature and crosses a line we should not cross because nature should be left as it is.
I am concerned that the government will not sufficiently regulate the use of gene editing, as I believe they often fall short in their regulatory efforts.
"I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because it will reduce human effort."
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a good idea for society because it will make their work faster and easier.
I believe most people would not feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains because our brains are still capable of further development, so people will prefer to stick to their natural process of learning and thinking.
"I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it will make their work faster and easier."
I believe that using gene editing to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious diseases is just another way we as humans strive to improve ourselves and help humanity.
I think that even if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, people's judgments and decision-making will remain about the same because humans will always be human.

Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing less fair, as it could lead to an increase in wrongful arrests and detentions.
I believe that even if police use facial recognition technology widely, the crime rate would stay about the same because criminals will ignore it and continue their activities regardless.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of facial recognition technology by the police, because I'm unsure how regulation alone would prevent its misuse.
I believe that if a facial recognition program identifies someone as a suspect, it shouldn't be used as the sole reason for arrest because the technology is not flawless and some police might be too quick to accuse someone. Instead, it should be one of several investigative leads that need to be thoroughly verified before any police action is taken.

"I don't think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would make much difference, as I don't see a connection."
I'm not sure if widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial or risky, mainly because I don't see the advantage unless it can significantly increase someone's IQ, which we desperately need, but I admit I'm completely uninformed on this topic.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, as demonstrated by the situation with Musk's Tesla.
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, most people would not feel pressured to get them because they will be too expensive and not likely covered by insurance, making them prohibitive, and many will also mistrust the technology for a long time.
"I think people's judgments and decision-making would be about the same as now, because I know nothing about this topic and I'm not comfortable judging its efficacy."

I would probably want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI computer system for manual labor because it would make me more capable.
I believe that the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby’s risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions over their lifetime would be a bad idea for society because, although these technologies are beneficial individually, they pose a global risk by potentially increasing population and consumption beyond our planet's limited resources.

Question: If the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, which is your greater concern?
Choices: ['Government will go too far regulating its use', 'Government will not go far enough regulating its use']

Opinions:
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a bad idea for society because, according to the news I've read, it sometimes leads to the arrest and detention of the wrong people.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing less fair, as it could lead to an increase in wrongful arrests and detentions.
I believe that even if police use facial recognition technology widely, the crime rate would stay about the same because criminals will ignore it and continue their activities regardless.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, as demonstrated by the situation with Musk's Tesla.
I'm concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain.
I believe that if a facial recognition program identifies someone as a suspect, it shouldn't be used as the sole reason for arrest because the technology is not flawless and some police might be too quick to accuse someone. Instead, it should be one of several investigative leads that need to be thoroughly verified before any police action is taken.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents, based on the news stories I've read.
"I don't think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would make much difference, as I don't see a connection."
I think that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because they're much safer than traditional travel with drivers, according to studies mentioned in reputable news sources I've read.
I believe that using computer chip implants in the brain to enhance our information processing capabilities is just another step in human advancement, similar to vaccinations and organ transplants, and doesn't constitute undue interference with nature.
"I think people's judgments and decision-making would be about the same as now, because I know nothing about this topic and I'm not comfortable judging its efficacy."
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, most people would not feel pressured to get them because they will be too expensive and not likely covered by insurance, making them prohibitive, and many will also mistrust the technology for a long time.
I believe that using gene editing to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious diseases is just another step in our ongoing effort to improve ourselves, similar to other forms of modern medicine, and I support it because we all want the best care for ourselves and our loved ones.
I'm not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of passengers or pedestrians, because it really depends on the specific situation and the degree of harm that could occur to each party involved.
I'm not sure if widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial or risky, mainly because I don't see the advantage unless it can significantly increase someone's IQ, which we desperately need, but I admit I'm completely uninformed on this topic.
I believe driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using existing standards used for regular passenger vehicles because I don't see any reason to change the safety standards.

I believe driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using existing standards used for regular passenger vehicles because I don't see any reason to change the safety standards.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, as demonstrated by the situation with Musk's Tesla.
I believe people should assume they are being monitored in public spaces because cameras are ubiquitous and there is no expectation of privacy when you are out in public; the presence of more surveillance cameras just reaffirms this reality.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be tested to a higher standard than typical workplace equipment to ensure that physical safety, particularly against spinal cord injuries, is almost guaranteed.
I am more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of facial recognition technology by the police, because I'm unsure how regulation alone would prevent its misuse.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be designed to accommodate a wide range of worker body types, even if this increases their cost, because employers will pay the necessary amount if it significantly boosts worker productivity.

Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will not make much difference in policing, as so much of policing is done 'in the moment' that it won't have much impact on fairness overall.
I think that if facial recognition technology became widespread in police use, it might lead to a slight decrease in crime in the U.S., because it would be harder for criminals to evade capture, although the decrease wouldn't be very significant.
I am more concerned that the government will not sufficiently regulate the use of facial recognition technology, allowing third parties to potentially abuse it.
I believe that it shouldn't be sufficient for police to arrest someone based solely on facial recognition evidence if there is a small chance of error; they should also verify the absence of a credible alibi and the presence of corroborative witnesses.
I believe the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because people make more errors than computers, and removing the human element would likely make the roads safer overall.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because computers are less prone to errors and carelessness than humans.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would not significantly affect the existing, gigantic income disparity between higher and lower income Americans.
"I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial or harmful, as there isn't enough information about their physical or mental impact on people."
I am concerned that if the government does not sufficiently regulate driverless vehicles, the emergence of incompatible third-party standards could lead to unsafe roads.
I believe that if brain chip implants become affordable and common, most people would feel pressured to get one due to a fear of missing out, especially if their friends and family decide to use the technology.
I believe that even if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, they wouldn't make people any smarter or dumber, so their judgment and decision-making would remain about the same as it is now.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, particularly because it could speed up construction and manufacturing, which would likely result in lower prices and better outcomes.
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain sufficiently because it tends to move too slowly and is easily swayed by the corporations that develop this technology.
I'm not sure how computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize safety in an unavoidable accident because it's a deep moral problem, and I sympathize with those who have to make this decision.
I would probably want to use a robotic exoskeleton with built-in artificial intelligence for manual labor because it could help me lift logs and limbs in my yard after a tree falls, making it somewhat useful.
I believe that the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions is a good idea for society, because some diseases are far too terrible to ignore, and if gene editing presents a solution, we should use it to its full potential.

Question Label: FACEREC10_W99
Prompt: 
Question: If a facial recognition program said that someone was involved in a crime, should that be good enough evidence for police to arrest them, even if there was a small chance the program was wrong?
Choices: ['Yes', 'No']

Opinions:
I think that if facial recognition technology became widespread in police use, it might lead to a slight decrease in crime in the U.S., because it would be harder for criminals to evade capture, although the decrease wouldn't be very significant.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be beneficial or harmful; it could help catch criminals, but it also raises significant privacy concerns and feels very 'big brother-like'.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will not make much difference in policing, as so much of policing is done 'in the moment' that it won't have much impact on fairness overall.
I am more concerned that the government will not sufficiently regulate the use of facial recognition technology, allowing third parties to potentially abuse it.
I believe that even if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, they wouldn't make people any smarter or dumber, so their judgment and decision-making would remain about the same as it is now.

"I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial or harmful, as there isn't enough information about their physical or mental impact on people."
I would probably want to use a robotic exoskeleton with built-in artificial intelligence for manual labor because it could help me lift logs and limbs in my yard after a tree falls, making it somewhat useful.
I believe that if brain chip implants become affordable and common, most people would feel pressured to get one due to a fear of missing out, especially if their friends and family decide to use the technology.

I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would not significantly affect the existing, gigantic income disparity between higher and lower income Americans.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be held to a higher standard of testing than traditional medical devices because the technology is extremely novel and its effects on the mind and body are not well understood.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested to a higher standard than regular passenger vehicles because this would significantly enhance safety for all road users, including other motorists and pedestrians.
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain sufficiently because it tends to move too slowly and is easily swayed by the corporations that develop this technology.
I believe robotic exoskeletons should be tested using a higher standard than that used for regular workplace equipment because they involve new technologies whose use and impact are not as well understood.

Prompt: 
Question: If the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, allowing people to far more quickly and accurately process information, do you think people’s judgments and decision-making would be…
Choices: ['Better than now', 'Worse than now', 'About the same as now']

Opinions:
I believe that if brain chip implants become affordable and common, most people would feel pressured to get one due to a fear of missing out, especially if their friends and family decide to use the technology.
"I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial or harmful, as there isn't enough information about their physical or mental impact on people."
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain sufficiently because it tends to move too slowly and is easily swayed by the corporations that develop this technology.
I believe that the use of computer chip implants in the brain is just another step in our continual effort to improve ourselves, similar to how people forty years ago adapted to the introduction of smartphones.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be held to a higher standard of testing than traditional medical devices because the technology is extremely novel and its effects on the mind and body are not well understood.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would not significantly affect the existing, gigantic income disparity between higher and lower income Americans.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because computers are less prone to errors and carelessness than humans.
I believe the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because people make more errors than computers, and removing the human element would likely make the roads safer overall.
I am concerned that if the government does not sufficiently regulate driverless vehicles, the emergence of incompatible third-party standards could lead to unsafe roads.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be beneficial or harmful; it could help catch criminals, but it also raises significant privacy concerns and feels very 'big brother-like'.
I'm not sure how computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize safety in an unavoidable accident because it's a deep moral problem, and I sympathize with those who have to make this decision.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, particularly because it could speed up construction and manufacturing, which would likely result in lower prices and better outcomes.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will not make much difference in policing, as so much of policing is done 'in the moment' that it won't have much impact on fairness overall.
I believe that if gene editing were used to eliminate hereditary diseases like Huntington's, Tay-Sachs, or certain cancers, people's quality of life would be greatly enhanced because they would not have to suffer from these severe conditions.
I think that if facial recognition technology became widespread in police use, it might lead to a slight decrease in crime in the U.S., because it would be harder for criminals to evade capture, although the decrease wouldn't be very significant.
I am more concerned that the government will not sufficiently regulate the use of facial recognition technology, allowing third parties to potentially abuse it.

Question Label: EXOV3_W99
Prompt: 
Question: Would you personally want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in artificial intelligence computer system for manual labor, if you had the opportunity?
Choices: ['Definitely want', 'Probably want', 'Probably NOT want', 'Definitely NOT want']

Opinions:
I believe that if the use of robotic exoskeletons in manual labor becomes widespread, conditions for workers would improve, mainly because these devices can prevent injuries caused by lifting heavy objects.
I believe that the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, particularly because it could speed up construction and manufacturing, which would likely result in lower prices and better outcomes.
I am concerned that if the government does not sufficiently regulate and test robotic exoskeletons used in manual labor, it could result in injuries or accidents that may lead to hospitalizations or even death.
I believe robotic exoskeletons should be tested using a higher standard than that used for regular workplace equipment because they involve new technologies whose use and impact are not as well understood.
I believe it's acceptable to manufacture robotic exoskeletons that only fit the typical body types of manual labor workers if it helps lower the cost, because I don't see much use in creating them for atypical body types and I'm not sure what other jobs would benefit from them. Plus, I think these exoskeletons would likely be expensive, so reducing costs seems beneficial.
I believe that if brain chip implants become affordable and common, most people would feel pressured to get one due to a fear of missing out, especially if their friends and family decide to use the technology.
"I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial or harmful, as there isn't enough information about their physical or mental impact on people."
I believe the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because people make more errors than computers, and removing the human element would likely make the roads safer overall.
I believe that even if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, they wouldn't make people any smarter or dumber, so their judgment and decision-making would remain about the same as it is now.
I would definitely want gene editing for my baby to greatly reduce their risk of developing inherited diseases, as I always want what's best for my child and would do anything to prevent them from enduring serious health issues.
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain sufficiently because it tends to move too slowly and is easily swayed by the corporations that develop this technology.
I'm not sure how computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize safety in an unavoidable accident because it's a deep moral problem, and I sympathize with those who have to make this decision.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because computers are less prone to errors and carelessness than humans.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would not significantly affect the existing, gigantic income disparity between higher and lower income Americans.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be beneficial or harmful; it could help catch criminals, but it also raises significant privacy concerns and feels very 'big brother-like'.
I am concerned that if the government does not sufficiently regulate driverless vehicles, the emergence of incompatible third-party standards could lead to unsafe roads.

Question: If a facial recognition program said that someone was involved in a crime, should that be good enough evidence for police to arrest them, even if there was a small chance the program was wrong?
Choices: ['Yes', 'No']

Opinions:
I believe that even if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the overall crime rate would stay about the same because people committing crimes often act out of desperation and don't consider the consequences like being caught through facial recognition.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police is a bad idea for society because it raises privacy concerns and I don't trust the police to use it responsibly.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing less fair because the technology can be manipulated to harm and exploit people, and it is also susceptible to being faked.

Question: Would you personally want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in artificial intelligence computer system for manual labor, if you had the opportunity?
Choices: ['Definitely want', 'Probably want', 'Probably NOT want', 'Definitely NOT want']

Opinions:
I believe that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, conditions for workers would be better than now because they would have added protections and abilities, making them much safer.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because it could significantly assist individuals working in physically demanding environments and also restore mobility to those who need it.
I am concerned that if robotic exoskeletons for manual labor become widespread, the government will go too far in regulating their use, limiting their potential due to overzealous safety concerns.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be tested using existing standards used for workplace equipment because they will be performing the same tasks, and it would be fair to hold them to these established standards.
I believe it's acceptable to initially manufacture robotic exoskeletons that only fit the typical body types of manual labor workers if it helps lower the cost, since having an exoskeleton that fits your specific body type isn't a right. Over time, as the technology improves, it should become easier to offer a wider variety of models.

I definitely would not want gene editing for my baby because altering genes is dangerous and could lead to serious issues, potentially causing our species to go extinct; it's like playing with a loaded gun.
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain sufficiently, allowing companies to exploit these modifications for their own benefit.
"I am not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of one group over another in the event of an unavoidable accident, because it seems impossible to choose; both deserve to be prioritized equally and there's no right choice in such a situation."
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because it removes human error and incompetency from the equation.
"I believe that even if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it won't make much difference because the rich will continue to have their stranglehold on society."
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police is a bad idea for society because it raises privacy concerns and I don't trust the police to use it responsibly.

Prompt: 
Question: If a facial recognition program said that someone was involved in a crime, should that be good enough evidence for police to arrest them, even if there was a small chance the program was wrong?
Choices: ['Yes', 'No']

Opinions:
I believe that if police widely adopt facial recognition technology, crime would decrease in the U.S. because people might be deterred from committing crimes if they know they are being watched by cameras.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a good idea for society because it could help narrow down suspects, although it might also be seen as an invasion of privacy for non-suspects.
I believe the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will not make much difference because it won't hinder initial bias or address crimes where cameras are not used.
I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will not regulate it enough to prevent cities from turning into police states with cameras monitoring every single move.
I believe that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread and enable people to process information more quickly and accurately, people's judgments and decision-making would be better than they are now because more information almost always leads to better decision making.
I believe that in the event of an unavoidable accident, driverless vehicles should be programmed to prioritize the safety of the vehicle's passengers, as they are the users of the system and deserve protection.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial because, while they could increase productivity and efficiency, they might also make people overly dependent on the technology and less reliant on their own intelligence.
I would definitely want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI computer system for manual labor, because it would make the work much easier and less taxing on my body.
I think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains to keep up with others who have access to faster and more accurate information processing.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because it could increase productivity by allowing people to work on other things during their commutes.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because human error would no longer be a factor and machines have proven to be much more accurate than humans in other aspects of life.
I believe the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles wouldn't make much of a difference because the type of car people drive is less significant compared to other societal aspects.
I believe that computer chip implants in the brain should be tested using a higher standard than that used for medical devices, because when something is implanted directly into a person, it should meet very strict regulatory standards to prevent severe consequences.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using a higher standard than used for regular passenger vehicles because much of the driverless technology has not yet been utilized on a large scale.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, despite believing that the government should help address the vulnerabilities and security risks associated with relying on these chips.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be tested using a higher standard than that used for other workplace equipment because advanced technology requires greater scrutiny until it has a long history of use.

Prompt: 
Question: If the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, allowing people to far more quickly and accurately process information, do you think people’s judgments and decision-making would be…
Choices: ['Better than now', 'Worse than now', 'About the same as now']

Opinions:
I think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains to keep up with others who have access to faster and more accurate information processing.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial because, while they could increase productivity and efficiency, they might also make people overly dependent on the technology and less reliant on their own intelligence.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, despite believing that the government should help address the vulnerabilities and security risks associated with relying on these chips.
I believe that the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is just another step in human advancement, improving how we process data and information.
I believe that computer chip implants in the brain should be tested using a higher standard than that used for medical devices, because when something is implanted directly into a person, it should meet very strict regulatory standards to prevent severe consequences.
I believe the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles wouldn't make much of a difference because the type of car people drive is less significant compared to other societal aspects.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless vehicles would decrease the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because human error would no longer be a factor and machines have proven to be much more accurate than humans in other aspects of life.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a good idea for society because it could increase productivity by allowing people to work on other things during their commutes.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of driverless passenger vehicles, as there need to be safeguards in place to protect passengers who are relying on these systems while vulnerable.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a good idea for society because it could help narrow down suspects, although it might also be seen as an invasion of privacy for non-suspects.
I believe that in the event of an unavoidable accident, driverless vehicles should be programmed to prioritize the safety of the vehicle's passengers, as they are the users of the system and deserve protection.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society because it would enable people to perform more work without fear of injuring themselves.
I believe the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will not make much difference because it won't hinder initial bias or address crimes where cameras are not used.
I think people’s quality of life would be better than now if gene editing were used widely to reduce a baby’s risk of serious diseases, because it would prevent disabilities and the financial burden of health issues, significantly improving lives.
I believe that if police widely adopt facial recognition technology, crime would decrease in the U.S. because people might be deterred from committing crimes if they know they are being watched by cameras.
I am concerned that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will not regulate it enough to prevent cities from turning into police states with cameras monitoring every single move.

I am concerned that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, the government will go too far in regulating their use and we will end up with no privacy whatsoever.
"I'm not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize individual safety over other considerations because I think the safety needs to be considered from the whole car, starting from the outside and working in."
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in artificial intelligence for manual labor because I wouldn't want anyone to think I was cheating or to mistakenly use my enhanced strength and end up hurting someone.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby’s risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions over their lifetime would be beneficial, because, although it would be great if my son didn't have autism, children who came before him could benefit from testing and breakthroughs aimed at curing it and other diseases.

Question: If a facial recognition program said that someone was involved in a crime, should that be good enough evidence for police to arrest them, even if there was a small chance the program was wrong?
Choices: ['Yes', 'No']

Opinions:
I think that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime rates would stay about the same because it may work well in some locations but not in others.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a bad idea for society because there are issues like those faced by my fraternal twin nieces, who were able to unlock each other's phones by mistake using facial recognition, which was both confusing and unsettling.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police won't make much difference because they will arrest and charge who they want regardless of the technology, which might even negatively impact their quotas.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of facial recognition technology by police, as the effectiveness of regulation could vary depending on who is in office and the political climate at the time.
I think people's judgments and decision-making would stay about the same as now, because not everyone would have the chip.
"I'm not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize individual safety over other considerations because I think the safety needs to be considered from the whole car, starting from the outside and working in."
I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial, as it might lead to quick decision-making without considering multiple scenarios.
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in artificial intelligence for manual labor because I wouldn't want anyone to think I was cheating or to mistakenly use my enhanced strength and end up hurting someone.
I think most people would feel pressure to get computer chip implants in their brains to keep up with others and due to societal expectations.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because it would require several hours of mechanical teaching to maintain the cars, as well as additional infrastructure like storage locations and garages built for production.

I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be subject to a higher standard of testing than typical medical devices because the risk of hacking is so significant.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using a higher standard than what is used for regular passenger vehicles because there's a lot to consider with these types of vehicles; I've seen firsthand tractors that didn't respond properly, nearly causing accidents.
I am concerned that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, the government will go too far in regulating their use and we will end up with no privacy whatsoever.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be tested to a higher standard than typical workplace equipment to prevent injury to the humans operating them.

Question: If the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, allowing people to far more quickly and accurately process information, do you think people’s judgments and decision-making would be…
Choices: ['Better than now', 'Worse than now', 'About the same as now']

Opinions:
I think most people would feel pressure to get computer chip implants in their brains to keep up with others and due to societal expectations.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be beneficial, as it might lead to quick decision-making without considering multiple scenarios.
I am concerned that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, the government will go too far in regulating their use and we will end up with no privacy whatsoever.
I believe that the idea of using computer chip implants in the brain crosses a line we shouldn't cross because it meddles with nature and imposes programming that dictates how and what people should think and do.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be subject to a higher standard of testing than typical medical devices because the risk of hacking is so significant.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents due to potential computer system failures or glitches while in route, causing accidents with manually driven cars.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles wouldn't make much difference because not all areas in the country can accommodate these cars due to varying weather conditions, leading to potential widespread outages.
I think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because it would require several hours of mechanical teaching to maintain the cars, as well as additional infrastructure like storage locations and garages built for production.
I am more concerned that the government will overregulate driverless passenger vehicles; I believe it should be the manufacturers’ responsibility to maintain and manage these vehicles, as the government already has plenty of other issues to address. Plus, we should be focusing on flying cars rather than driverless ones by now.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a bad idea for society because there are issues like those faced by my fraternal twin nieces, who were able to unlock each other's phones by mistake using facial recognition, which was both confusing and unsettling.
"I'm not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize individual safety over other considerations because I think the safety needs to be considered from the whole car, starting from the outside and working in."
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a bad idea for society because it could lead to issues similar to those caused by steroids in the professional world.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police won't make much difference because they will arrest and charge who they want regardless of the technology, which might even negatively impact their quotas.
I think people’s quality of life would be about the same as now if the use of gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of serious diseases becomes widespread, because there could still be issues that arise after its implementation.
I think that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime rates would stay about the same because it may work well in some locations but not in others.
I am concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating the use of facial recognition technology by police, as the effectiveness of regulation could vary depending on who is in office and the political climate at the time.

Question Label: FACEREC2_W99
Prompt: 
Question: Do you think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a…
Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it enhances accountability, reduces resource wastage, and prevents wrongful arrests, ultimately benefiting society.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S. because people concerned about being hidden from the police and those contemplating crimes would feel constantly monitored, leading to a change of mind and promoting more moral behavior.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of facial recognition technology, possibly because some officials might exploit it for personal gain or use regulations to favor specific groups or dismiss certain political crimes.
"I believe that police should arrest someone if a facial recognition program identifies them as a suspect in a crime, because it's important to apprehend potential criminals promptly, even if there's a small chance the identification is incorrect."
I'm not sure if the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be good or bad for society because, while it's exciting to try new technologies and enjoy their luxuries, many people, including myself, might be uncomfortable not being in control, which could lead to fears about safety and privacy concerns like derailments, accidents, or surveillance by the companies.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because when one doesn't have control of a car, it can malfunction and cause accidents. Additionally, its algorithm or code, whether on a server or home base, can be hijacked by criminals for various crimes, including intentionally causing fatal accidents.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles will not make much difference in the long run, as initially it may create a gap with higher income Americans adopting it, but eventually, these vehicles will become more affordable and primarily used for public transport in an Uber style.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it's like turning humans into robots or lab rats.
I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not regulate their use adequately, particularly in terms of additional infrastructure, which could compromise safety standards and increase costs.

Prompt: 
Question: Do you think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing…
Choices: ['More fair', 'Less fair', 'Not make much difference']

Opinions:
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a good idea for society because if used without bias, it can reduce investigation times, lower crime rates, enable timely interventions, bring criminals to justice, and help safeguard society.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S. because people concerned about being hidden from the police and those contemplating crimes would feel constantly monitored, leading to a change of mind and promoting more moral behavior.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of facial recognition technology, possibly because some officials might exploit it for personal gain or use regulations to favor specific groups or dismiss certain political crimes.
"I believe that police should arrest someone if a facial recognition program identifies them as a suspect in a crime, because it's important to apprehend potential criminals promptly, even if there's a small chance the identification is incorrect."
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because when one doesn't have control of a car, it can malfunction and cause accidents. Additionally, its algorithm or code, whether on a server or home base, can be hijacked by criminals for various crimes, including intentionally causing fatal accidents.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles will not make much difference in the long run, as initially it may create a gap with higher income Americans adopting it, but eventually, these vehicles will become more affordable and primarily used for public transport in an Uber style.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be good or bad for society because, while it's exciting to try new technologies and enjoy their luxuries, many people, including myself, might be uncomfortable not being in control, which could lead to fears about safety and privacy concerns like derailments, accidents, or surveillance by the companies.
I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not regulate their use adequately, particularly in terms of additional infrastructure, which could compromise safety standards and increase costs.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it's like turning humans into robots or lab rats.

I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested to a higher standard than that used for traditional medical devices because ensuring patient safety requires neurosurgeons to update their expertise on how the brain interacts with these chips.
I am concerned that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate their use, focusing on aspects such as durability, specific applications, and health concerns.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of facial recognition technology, possibly because some officials might exploit it for personal gain or use regulations to favor specific groups or dismiss certain political crimes.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it's like turning humans into robots or lab rats.
I think most people would not feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains, as they wouldn't allow anyone to meddle with their brain that way.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a good idea for society because if used without bias, it can reduce investigation times, lower crime rates, enable timely interventions, bring criminals to justice, and help safeguard society.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it enhances accountability, reduces resource wastage, and prevents wrongful arrests, ultimately benefiting society.
I would probably want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI computer system for manual labor because I want to feel the joy and power it provides, almost like having supernatural abilities.

Question: If the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, which is your greater concern?
Choices: ['Government will go too far regulating their use', 'Government will not go far enough regulating their use']

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because when one doesn't have control of a car, it can malfunction and cause accidents. Additionally, its algorithm or code, whether on a server or home base, can be hijacked by criminals for various crimes, including intentionally causing fatal accidents.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles will not make much difference in the long run, as initially it may create a gap with higher income Americans adopting it, but eventually, these vehicles will become more affordable and primarily used for public transport in an Uber style.

Choices: ['Good idea for society', 'Bad idea for society', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I think most parents would feel pressure to get gene editing for their baby, especially if they have seen its benefits in others.
I believe that if gene editing is widely used to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious diseases or health conditions, the quality of life will be better than it is now because it is akin to immunizing a baby before they are fully formed, aiming to reduce or eliminate serious health issues through well-researched applications.
I would definitely want gene editing for my baby to greatly reduce their risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions, because having a healthy baby brings a lifetime of joy and the opportunity to watch them grow into a fine, healthy adult.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of gene editing, as they will insist on extensive testing and long-term monitoring to ensure safety and compliance with standards.
I believe that using gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases is just another way we are trying to improve ourselves and ensure the best possible health conditions.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it's like turning humans into robots or lab rats.
I'm more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain, potentially affecting people's consent to be implanted and the safety of these devices, as well as prioritizing how the information in the chip is used.
I think most people would not feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains, as they wouldn't allow anyone to meddle with their brain that way.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, as it would provide additional strength for people in manual labor, enhancing their daily activities, and could also be used for self-promotion or self-defense by others.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested to a higher standard than that used for traditional medical devices because ensuring patient safety requires neurosurgeons to update their expertise on how the brain interacts with these chips.
I believe that if the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, people's judgments and decision-making would be worse than now because the chips would force them to follow a set of programmed rules, compromising their natural thought processes and possibly making them less trustworthy as humans.
I believe that implanting computer chips in the brain crosses a line we should not cross because it meddles with nature and risks losing human free will, potentially turning people into controlled zombies.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be good or bad for society because, while it's exciting to try new technologies and enjoy their luxuries, many people, including myself, might be uncomfortable not being in control, which could lead to fears about safety and privacy concerns like derailments, accidents, or surveillance by the companies.
I am concerned that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate their use, focusing on aspects such as durability, specific applications, and health concerns.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a good idea for society because if used without bias, it can reduce investigation times, lower crime rates, enable timely interventions, bring criminals to justice, and help safeguard society.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles will not make much difference in the long run, as initially it may create a gap with higher income Americans adopting it, but eventually, these vehicles will become more affordable and primarily used for public transport in an Uber style.

I believe that if the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, people's judgments and decision-making would be worse than now because the chips would force them to follow a set of programmed rules, compromising their natural thought processes and possibly making them less trustworthy as humans.
I believe that implanting computer chips in the brain crosses a line we should not cross because it meddles with nature and risks losing human free will, potentially turning people into controlled zombies.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of gene editing, as they will insist on extensive testing and long-term monitoring to ensure safety and compliance with standards.

Question Label: EXOV7_W99
Prompt: 
Question: Thinking about the manufacturing of robotic exoskeletons, which of the following statements comes closest to your view, even if neither is exactly right?
Choices: ['Robotic exoskeletons should only be made if they fit a wide range of worker body types, even if that increases their cost', 'It’s okay to make robotic exoskeletons that just fit the typical body types of manual labor workers in order to lower the cost', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I believe that robotic exoskeletons for manual labor should be tested to a higher standard than typical workplace equipment to ensure they are in good condition and can undergo diagnostics to measure their strength and lifespan, preventing accidents due to sudden power or strength loss.
I am concerned that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate their use, focusing on aspects such as durability, specific applications, and health concerns.
I believe that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, conditions for workers would be better than they are now, because workers would not need to exert as much human strength; they would simply control the exoskeleton they wear, making their jobs easier.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a good idea for society, as it would provide additional strength for people in manual labor, enhancing their daily activities, and could also be used for self-promotion or self-defense by others.
I would probably want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI computer system for manual labor because I want to feel the joy and power it provides, almost like having supernatural abilities.
I believe that implanted computer chips in the brain should be tested to a higher standard than that used for traditional medical devices because ensuring patient safety requires neurosurgeons to update their expertise on how the brain interacts with these chips.
I believe that people should assume they are being monitored in public spaces for safety reasons, viewing it as an advanced form of CCTV, while maintaining privacy in private spaces like homes.
I believe that implanting computer chips in the brain crosses a line we should not cross because it meddles with nature and risks losing human free will, potentially turning people into controlled zombies.
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using a higher standard than what is used for regular passenger vehicles, because they require more stringent testing, certification, and safety standards, along with necessary infrastructure adjustments.
I'm more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of computer chip implants in the brain, potentially affecting people's consent to be implanted and the safety of these devices, as well as prioritizing how the information in the chip is used.
I believe that using gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases is just another way we are trying to improve ourselves and ensure the best possible health conditions.
I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will not regulate their use adequately, particularly in terms of additional infrastructure, which could compromise safety standards and increase costs.
I'm not sure if the computer systems guiding driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of those inside or outside the vehicle, as it might depend on the number of people involved and the specific circumstances of the accident.
I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of gene editing, as they will insist on extensive testing and long-term monitoring to ensure safety and compliance with standards.
I believe that if the use of computer chip implants in the brain becomes widespread, people's judgments and decision-making would be worse than now because the chips would force them to follow a set of programmed rules, compromising their natural thought processes and possibly making them less trustworthy as humans.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it's like turning humans into robots or lab rats.

I am more concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the use of facial recognition technology, possibly because some officials might exploit it for personal gain or use regulations to favor specific groups or dismiss certain political crimes.
I believe that implanting computer chips in the brain crosses a line we should not cross because it meddles with nature and risks losing human free will, potentially turning people into controlled zombies.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because when one doesn't have control of a car, it can malfunction and cause accidents. Additionally, its algorithm or code, whether on a server or home base, can be hijacked by criminals for various crimes, including intentionally causing fatal accidents.
I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles will not make much difference in the long run, as initially it may create a gap with higher income Americans adopting it, but eventually, these vehicles will become more affordable and primarily used for public transport in an Uber style.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be good or bad for society because, while it's exciting to try new technologies and enjoy their luxuries, many people, including myself, might be uncomfortable not being in control, which could lead to fears about safety and privacy concerns like derailments, accidents, or surveillance by the companies.
I believe that using gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases is just another way we are trying to improve ourselves and ensure the best possible health conditions.

Opinions:
I don't think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would make much difference.
I'm not sure how I feel about the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles or how it would affect driving.
"I am concerned that if driverless passenger vehicles become widespread, the government will go too far in regulating their use; they should only implement necessary safety regulations."
"I am not sure if the computer systems guiding driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of one group over another, because both lives are important."
"I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police won't make much of a difference; it might help, but the impact wouldn't be significant."
I believe that driverless passenger vehicles should be tested using a higher standard than that used for regular passenger vehicles, involving countless hours of testing and coding.
I think that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime levels would likely stay about the same because there's already widespread surveillance, yet crimes still occur.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a bad thing.
I'm more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of facial recognition technology by police, because I worry it might be used for the wrong purposes.
I'm not sure if the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be good or bad, because it could be harmful if it ends up in the wrong hands.
I think it would be evenly split between people who feel pressured to get computer chip implants in the brain and those who do not, as it really depends on individual choice and opposition.
I think that the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain would be a good idea for society, especially once all the initial trial and error issues are resolved.
I am concerned that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, the government will go too far in regulating their use because they would want complete control like everything else.

Opinions:
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it can help accurately identify individuals, reducing errors in finding the right person.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S. because people would be aware they could easily be identified and caught by the system after committing a crime, which would deter criminal activity.
I am more concerned that the government will not sufficiently regulate the use of facial recognition technology by police, even though it helps in identifying individuals needed by authorities.

Choices: ['Government will go too far regulating its use', 'Government will not go far enough regulating its use']

Opinions:
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police would be a good idea for society because it could help to catch criminals.
I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it can help accurately identify individuals, reducing errors in finding the right person.
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S. because people would be aware they could easily be identified and caught by the system after committing a crime, which would deter criminal activity.
I believe the government will go too far in regulating the use of computer chip implants in the brain, and I see no need for this regulation at all.
I believe that if a facial recognition program identifies someone as involved in a crime, it should be sufficient grounds for an arrest, provided that there is further investigation to confirm the accuracy of the program's identification.

I think that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles wouldn’t really make much difference, since it doesn’t matter to me whether cars are driven by people or not.
"I'm not sure if the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be good or bad, because it could either increase or decrease accidents, depending on how it's implemented and if there are no significant glitches."
I believe that using gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of disease is meddling with nature and crosses a moral line that should not even be considered.
I think that using computer chip implants in the brain for faster and more accurate information processing is a bad idea for society because it is not safe at all.
I don't think most people would feel pressured to get computer chip implants in their brains, as it's not something that most would want.
I think that if computer chip implants in the brain become widespread, people's judgments and decision-making would be worse than now because we are not robots and should not have chips in our brains; computers often have glitches and errors, and it's unpredictable how this might affect a person.
I believe that in the case of an unavoidable accident, the computer systems guiding driverless vehicles should be designed to prioritize the safety of the vehicle’s passengers because people's lives come first and foremost.
I believe that using gene editing widely to significantly lower a baby's risk of serious diseases or health conditions is a bad idea for society because babies are born the way they should be.

Opinions:
"I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it addresses those who think they are above the law or do not care about it, by showing them that they cannot escape detection and accountability."
I believe that if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, crime would decrease in the U.S., even in areas without this technology, because people would become paranoid and avoid committing crimes in person.
I am most concerned that, if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate its deployment, potentially installing it in extremely inappropriate places like bathrooms and in every corner of impoverished neighborhoods, leading to a pervasive sense of surveillance that makes people uncomfortable.
I don't believe that facial recognition alone should be sufficient evidence for an arrest if there's any chance of inaccuracy; the police should seek additional proof like DNA or eyewitness accounts to confirm they have the correct suspect.
"I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because they may perform actions independently, and relying heavily on technology that can fail is terrible for road safety."
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because people will become overly reliant on them and let their guard down, leading to more accidents.
I don't think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would make much difference, because if you can afford a self-driving vehicle, you can just as well afford a traditional vehicle of equal expense.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it seems like an attempt to turn people into machines, which is not the right direction for our lives.
I am more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially considering incidents where authorities have remotely intervened with vehicles, like stopping a car during a high-speed chase by contacting the car company, which could lead to more unwanted accidents.
I think most people would feel pressure to get computer chip implants in their brains because they would see others having an advantage and not want to be left at a disadvantage.
I believe that people's judgments and decision-making would be better with the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as it would help those who often act impulsively to think things through more carefully.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a bad idea for society because people would likely find a way to take advantage of them.
I am concerned that if brain chip implants become widespread, the government will overregulate their use and potentially use them to track us, which I definitely believe is going too far.
I'm not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of pedestrians or passengers more, because I believe both should be equally prioritized for safety, as is suggested by the impact-reducing technology used in Teslas.
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI for manual labor, although it might be useful for lifting or moving heavy things in my apartment that I couldn't manage on my own.
I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases would be a bad idea for society because it would lead people to falsely believe they are almost immortal, without concrete proof of resistance until we observe the outcomes over a person's entire life. Additionally, lifespan and health conditions are influenced by numerous other factors.

Question: In the case of an unavoidable accident, should the computer systems guiding driverless vehicles be designed to prioritize the safety of…
Choices: ['The vehicle’s passengers', 'Those outside of the vehicle', 'Not sure']

Opinions:
I am more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially considering incidents where authorities have remotely intervened with vehicles, like stopping a car during a high-speed chase by contacting the car company, which could lead to more unwanted accidents.
I don't think the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would make much difference, because if you can afford a self-driving vehicle, you can just as well afford a traditional vehicle of equal expense.
I believe that if the use of driverless passenger vehicles becomes widespread, it will increase the number of people killed or injured in traffic accidents because people will become overly reliant on them and let their guard down, leading to more accidents.
I believe that the existing standards used for regular passenger vehicles should also apply to driverless passenger vehicles, as these are the rules everyone else is following.
"I believe that the widespread use of driverless passenger vehicles would be a bad idea for society because they may perform actions independently, and relying heavily on technology that can fail is terrible for road safety."
I am concerned that if brain chip implants become widespread, the government will overregulate their use and potentially use them to track us, which I definitely believe is going too far.
I believe that people's judgments and decision-making would be better with the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as it would help those who often act impulsively to think things through more carefully.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons for manual labor should be tested using a higher standard than what is currently used for workplace equipment, to ensure proper standards are met for their safe and effective use.
I am concerned that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently, leading to situations where people could commit crimes or control others, which would be very bad.
I am most concerned that, if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread, the government will excessively regulate its deployment, potentially installing it in extremely inappropriate places like bathrooms and in every corner of impoverished neighborhoods, leading to a pervasive sense of surveillance that makes people uncomfortable.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it seems like an attempt to turn people into machines, which is not the right direction for our lives.
I think most people would feel pressure to get computer chip implants in their brains because they would see others having an advantage and not want to be left at a disadvantage.
I think the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police is a good idea for society because it can make it easier to identify offenders of violent and robbery crimes, and potentially reduce the likelihood of crimes happening in public.
"I believe that the widespread use of facial recognition technology by police will make policing more fair because it addresses those who think they are above the law or do not care about it, by showing them that they cannot escape detection and accountability."
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI for manual labor, although it might be useful for lifting or moving heavy things in my apartment that I couldn't manage on my own.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a bad idea for society because people would likely find a way to take advantage of them.

Question: If the use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby’s risk of developing serious diseases or health conditions over their lifetime becomes widespread, which statement better describes how you would feel about this development?
Choices: ['As humans, we are always trying to better ourselves and this idea is no different', 'This idea is meddling with nature and crosses a line we should not cross']

Opinions:
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of gene editing enough, and it could get out of control as these babies grow up and have children of their own, potentially leading to widespread effects that the government cannot predict or manage, possibly resulting in the next epidemic.
I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases would be a bad idea for society because it would lead people to falsely believe they are almost immortal, without concrete proof of resistance until we observe the outcomes over a person's entire life. Additionally, lifespan and health conditions are influenced by numerous other factors.
I think most parents would not feel pressured to use gene editing for their babies because they are more delicate and most humans would likely be very skeptical about it.
I believe that if gene editing becomes widespread to reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases, people's quality of life would be worse than now because there are too many unknowns and potential complications that outweigh the intended benefits.
I believe that the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is an unsettling development that meddles with nature and crosses a boundary we should not cross; it's simply unnatural, and I whole-heartedly agree with this stance.

I believe that the existing standards used for regular passenger vehicles should also apply to driverless passenger vehicles, as these are the rules everyone else is following.
I believe that robotic exoskeletons for manual labor should be tested using a higher standard than what is currently used for workplace equipment, to ensure proper standards are met for their safe and effective use.

I believe that using gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases is meddling with nature and crosses a line we should not cross; it should not be done at all.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it seems like an attempt to turn people into machines, which is not the right direction for our lives.
I think most people would feel pressure to get computer chip implants in their brains because they would see others having an advantage and not want to be left at a disadvantage.

Question Label: EXOV10_W99
Prompt: 
Question: Which statement comes closer to your view when it comes to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor? Robotic exoskeletons should be tested using…
Choices: ['Existing standards used for workplace equipment', 'A higher standard than used for workplace equipment']

Opinions:
I believe that robotic exoskeletons should be manufactured to accommodate a wide range of worker body types, even if this approach increases their cost, provided that they can be designed to extend or compact to fit various sizes initially.
I am concerned that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, the government will not regulate their use sufficiently, leading to situations where people could commit crimes or control others, which would be very bad.
I believe that the existing standards used for regular passenger vehicles should also apply to driverless passenger vehicles, as these are the rules everyone else is following.
I believe that if the use of robotic exoskeletons for manual labor becomes widespread, conditions for workers would be better than now because it could lead women into male-dominated work roles and allow for equal pay for all, which would be nice.
I think the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons would be a bad idea for society because people would likely find a way to take advantage of them.
I probably wouldn't want to use a robotic exoskeleton with a built-in AI for manual labor, although it might be useful for lifting or moving heavy things in my apartment that I couldn't manage on my own.
I believe that the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is an unsettling development that meddles with nature and crosses a boundary we should not cross; it's simply unnatural, and I whole-heartedly agree with this stance.
I believe that using gene editing to reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases is meddling with nature and crosses a line we should not cross; it should not be done at all.
I believe that people should assume they are being monitored in public spaces because they are in public, and if they want privacy, they should stay at home.
I'm not sure if computer systems in driverless vehicles should prioritize the safety of pedestrians or passengers more, because I believe both should be equally prioritized for safety, as is suggested by the impact-reducing technology used in Teslas.
I am concerned that if brain chip implants become widespread, the government will overregulate their use and potentially use them to track us, which I definitely believe is going too far.
I am concerned that the government will not regulate the use of gene editing enough, and it could get out of control as these babies grow up and have children of their own, potentially leading to widespread effects that the government cannot predict or manage, possibly resulting in the next epidemic.
I am more concerned that the government will overregulate the use of driverless passenger vehicles, especially considering incidents where authorities have remotely intervened with vehicles, like stopping a car during a high-speed chase by contacting the car company, which could lead to more unwanted accidents.
I think the widespread use of gene editing to greatly reduce a baby's risk of developing serious diseases would be a bad idea for society because it would lead people to falsely believe they are almost immortal, without concrete proof of resistance until we observe the outcomes over a person's entire life. Additionally, lifespan and health conditions are influenced by numerous other factors.
I believe that people's judgments and decision-making would be better with the use of computer chip implants in the brain, as it would help those who often act impulsively to think things through more carefully.
I think the widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain is a bad idea for society because it seems like an attempt to turn people into machines, which is not the right direction for our lives.
