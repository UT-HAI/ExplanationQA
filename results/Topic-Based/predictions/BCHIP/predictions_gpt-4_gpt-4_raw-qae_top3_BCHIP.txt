The planet has a limited amount of resources, and increasing population (or allowing the population to live longer) can't possibly be good for the human race in the long run. This topic makes me think of the old Charlton Heston movie "Soylent Green"."}

This ranges from bathrooms to on every corner of poor neighborhoods. I could imagine it getting to the point that people simply feel uncomfortable because they feel watched.
